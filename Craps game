Project: The purpose of this program is to simulate a game of craps. The user will have to press yes or no to
begin playing. once they press play the program will roll 2 dice. The player wins by rolling a 7 or an 11. if they 
roll a 2, 3 or 12 they lose. If they roll anythig else the game will continue until tyhey win or lose. they will have to
press enter everytime to roll. although C++ doesnâ€™t require any particular spacing I space things out to make it easier to
read.
